<h4 id="online-annotations">Online Annotations</h4>

<p>During the semester you will start at least three conversations in one of our readings, and respond to at least three others started by someone else. We will use the tool hypothes.is in order to do our annotation exchanges. Below is the schedule for our online exchanges:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Monday, September 19. Bush, Vannevar. “As We May Think.”</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="class-engagement">Class Engagement</h4>

<p>This course requires us to be present for each other. This doesn’t mean speaking during seminar. You really don’t have to if you don’t feel like it. What’s the point of requiring you to? That said, it is important that we are there for each other, helping each other out, doing our part, asking questions when we don’t understand something, answering them when we do. For the duration of the semester we are a collective, the team we have—Yankees or Bad News Bears, we are what we got.</p>

<h4 id="midterm-review">Midterm Review</h4>

<p>In this exercise you will choose a public digital humanities project and write a brief review.</p>

<p>[Details and criteria to come…]</p>

<h4 id="collective-research-project">Collective Research Project</h4>

<p>In this group exercise you will build a relatively simple digital humanities project with a team. In the process of doing so you will practice many of the skills you will learn during studio hours this semester, and experience the ins and outs of working with others on a shared research project. This assignment will be contract graded.</p>

<p>[Details and criteria to come…]</p>

<h4 id="scholarly-project-design-paper">Scholarly Project Design Paper</h4>

<p>In this exercise you will propose a dream (digital) scholarly research project to a potential funder.</p>

<p>[Details and criteria to come…]</p>
