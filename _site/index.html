    The cultural record of humanity is undergoing a massive and epochal
    transformation into shared analog and digital realities. While we are
    familiar with the history and realities of the analog record—libraries,
    archives, historical artifacts—the digital cultural record remains largely
    unexamined and relatively mysterious to humanities scholars. In this course
    you will be introduced to the broad field of Digital Humanities, theory and
    practice, through a stepwise exploration of the new architectures and genres
    of scholarly and humanistic production in the 21st century.
  </p>

  <p>
    The course combines a seminar preceded by a brief lecture, and a digital
    studio. Every week we will move through our discussions in tandem with
    hands-on exercises that will serve to illuminate our readings and help you
    gain a measure of computational proficiency useful in humanities
    scholarship. You will learn about the basics of plain text, file and
    operating systems, data structures and internet infrastructure. You will
    also learn to understand, produce and evaluate a few popular genres of
    Digital Humanities, including, digital editions of literary or historical
    texts, collections and exhibits of primary sources and interactive maps.
    Finally, and perhaps the most important lesson of the semester, you will
    learn to collaborate with each other on a common research project.
